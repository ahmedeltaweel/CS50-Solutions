0.  BMP: 32 bit color, or over 4 billion
	GIF: 8 bits, 256 colors
	JPEG: 24 bit, 16 million
	PNG: 24 bit, 16 million
	
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression throws away some of the data in a file. 
	Lossless uses an algorithm to compress a file that is reversible, hence, 
	the quality of the file can move back and forth between the two states.
	
3.  JPEG
4.  Two things happened:
	* the system modifies the filename’s first character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
	* he system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters to the hard drive’s list of free clusters.
5.  Provides sufficient sanitization by writing ASCII NUL bytes or ( randome characters ) every address on the disk. 
6.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18 to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros
7.  It means that you intended to use specific data type in specific way. 
8.  BYTE is a 1 byte ,DWORD is a 4 bytes, a LONG is a 4 bytes, and a WORD is a 2 bytes.
9.  A WORD which denotes bfType.
10. bfSize specifies the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
	biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes.
11. the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap) and its origin is the upper left corner.
12. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure
13. As it might not be able to create outfile.
14. as we are reading one struture. 
15. The padding would be 3.
16. Sets the position indicator associated with the stream to a new position.
17. Constant indecating Current position of the file pointer
18. Someone who looks suspiciously like David Malan!
